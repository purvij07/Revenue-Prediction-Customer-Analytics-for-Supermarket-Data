# Revenue Prediction and Customer Analytics for Supermarket Data (Capstone Project)

## Introduction
Machine Learning is being used in a variety of industries as a result of advancements in the area and an increase in processing capacity. The retail sector is not an anomaly. Using sophisticated forecasting algorithms to more accurately estimate future sales and enhance product allocation and ordering procedures is one way that machine learning is being used in the retail industry.
Enhancing forecasting models for the retail sector can yield numerous benefits. Products are more readily available to consumers, and retailers are seen as a trustworthy source of commodities. For the stores, better forecasting performance can mean less waste from overstocking, which can have detrimental economic effects; more sales because understocking can reduce sales because of low product availability; and better staffing distribution. Consequently, the stores may benefit from higher prediction accuracy in a variety of ways, including:

**Pricing Strategies:** Forecasts that are precise enable the successful implementation of dynamic pricing. Supermarkets have the ability to modify their prices in response to the expected variations in demand, which can be caused by various circumstances.

**Strategic Decision Making:**  By offering insights into future trends, forecasting aids in long-term strategic planning. This can affect choices about product ranges, workforce levels, and even store layout.

**Enhancing Competitiveness:** Being able to anticipate and react quickly to market trends can provide supermarkets with a competitive advantage where a small margin can have a huge impact.
