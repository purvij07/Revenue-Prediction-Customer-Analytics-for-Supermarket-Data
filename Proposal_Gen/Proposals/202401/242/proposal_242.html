<h2>1 Objective:</h2>
<pre><code>        The aim of this study is to describe and analyze weaknesses within the budget to generate resources for health. 
        This will involve analysis of health budget practices in Zambia including its trends, composition, fiscal space, 
        efficiency and its sustainability within the public financial management framework to explain why resources are 
        not used effectively and explore why the function of risk pooling is a problem in the Zambian health care 
        financing system.

        1. To examine the trends and composition of health sector budget in Zambia from 1990 to 2018
        2. To analyze the fiscal space and domestic resource mobilization in Zambia.
        3. To measure the budget efficiency for health in Zambia.
        4. To explore and describe health sector budget sustainability in Zambia.

<h2>2 Dataset:</h2>
<pre><code>         The dataset for this project is sourced from various audited primary secondary sources. Primary data was collected
         using the standard questionnaire from donors, NGOs employers and private insruance schemes. Secondary data sources 
         were used for Government and Household expenditures. The data collection was conducted by trained research
         assistants who visited all sampled institutions under the supervision of the technical team. The team research
         vetted all the questionnaires used in collect primary data to ensure compliance with SHA 2011 methodology. 
        </code></pre>
<h2>3 Rationale:</h2>
<pre><code>        The rationale for this study is to justify the need for analyzing weaknesses within the budget process for health 
        resource generation in Zambia, including its trends, composition, fiscal space, efficiency, and sustainability, 
        in order to address the ineffective use of resources and the problem of risk pooling in the Zambian health care 
        financing system.

<h2>4 Approach:</h2>
<pre><code>        I plan on approaching this capstone through several steps.  

        1. Application of the SHA framework for systematic classification of health expenditures.
        2. Deployment of fiscal space decomposition on method using Cobb-Douglas production function.
        3. Accounting for fiscal space for health 1995 - 2018 using public expenditure on Health by Scheme.
        4. Measurement of budget efficiency using parametric and non-parametric methods, including DEA and FDH.
        5. To explore using Concept Mapping Financial Sustainability Framework approach.

<h2>6 Expected Number Students:</h2>
<pre><code>        For this project maximum 3 students can work on it.  
        </code></pre>
<h2>7 Possible Issues:</h2>
<pre><code>        The challenge is ensuring the availability and quality of data for the analysis of health budget trends, 
        fiscal space, and efficiency in Zambia.
